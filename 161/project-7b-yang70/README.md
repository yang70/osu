# project-7b

Write a function named reverse_list that takes as a parameter a list and and reverses the order of the elements in that list. It should not return anything - it should mutate the original list.  For example, if the original list is
```
[7, -3, 12, 9]
```
then after calling the function it should be
```
[9, 12, -3, 7]
```
The file must be named: reverse_list.py
