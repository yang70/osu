# project-6c

Write a class called Person that has two data members - the person's name and age.  It should have an init method that takes two values and uses them to initialize the data members.

Write a separate function (not part of the Person class) called std_dev that takes as a parameter a list of Person objects and returns the standard deviation of all their ages (the population standard deviation that uses a denominator of N, not the sample standard deviation, which uses a different denominator).

The files must be named: std_dev.py
