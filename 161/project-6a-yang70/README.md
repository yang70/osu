Write a function named find_median that takes as a parameter a list of numbers.  The function should return the median of those numbers, which will require it to sort the list.  If you're not familiar with calculating the median, please look that up.  Remember that the calculation is different for odd and even groups of values.

The file must be named: find_median.py
