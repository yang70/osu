# project-7a

Write a function named square_list that takes as a parameter a list and replaces each value with the square of that value. It should not return anything - it should mutate the original list.  For example, if the original list is
```
[7, -3, 12, 9]
```
then after calling the function it should be
```
[49, 9, 144, 81].
```
The file must be named: square_list.py
