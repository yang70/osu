Write a program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures.  The formula is:

F = (9/5)C + 32

where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature.  The program should prompt the user to input a Celsius temperature and should display the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.  It should display only the converted temperature without any text (not even a 'F').  When you run your program, it should match the following format:
```
Please enter a Celsius temperature.
-10.5
The equivalent Fahrenheit temperature is:
13.1
```
Don't worry if your program says that -10.5 Celsius is 13.09999... in Fahrenheit instead of 13.1.  Mathematically speaking, 13.1 and 13.09999... are equivalent.  On a computer, however, we can't store an infinite number of 9s, so we end up with two very slightly different values, but the auto-tester takes that into account.

The file must be named: temp_convert.py
