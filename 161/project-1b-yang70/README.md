# project-1b

Alter the code for project 1.a so that it asks the user for their name and then greets them by name.  Remember to include the name, date and (updated) description comments.

Example of program execution:
```
Please enter your name: Jonas
Hello Jonas!
```
You must use the same wording as the example.

Your testing of your assignments should not be limited to any examples I provide.  You should always run other tests on your code to make sure it meets all the specifications.

The file must be named: greeting.py
