# project-1a

Create a Python file named animal.py.  Type the following code into the file, but with **your name** and the **current date**:
```
# Author: Tim Alcon
# Date: 1/1/1970
# Description: Asks the user for their favorite animal and then
#              prints out that that is their favorite animal

fave_animal = input("Please enter your favorite animal: ")
print("Your favorite animal is the " + fave_animal + ".")
```
Now save the file ("File/Save All") and run it.  The program should ask you to enter the name of your favorite animal, and after you do, it will print out "Your favorite animal is the \<whatever you typed\>."  

Once you've verified that your program compiles and runs correctly, commit and push your project.  Then go to Gradescope and submit your animal.py file from your GitHub repository.
