# project-8b

Write a function named words_in_both that takes two strings as parameters and returns a set of the words contained in both strings.  You can assume all characters are letters or spaces.  Capitalization shouldn't matter: "to", "To", "tO", and "TO" should all count as the same word.  The words in the set should be all lower-case.  For example, if one string contains "To", and the other string contains "TO", then the set should contain "to".

The file must be named: words_in_both.py
