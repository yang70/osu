# project-4a

The following formula can be used to determine the distance an object falls due to gravity in a specific time period:

d = (1/2)gt<sup>2</sup>

where d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the time in seconds that the object has been falling.  Write a function named fall_distance that takes the falling time as an argument.  The function should return the distance in meters that the object has fallen in that time.  For example if the function is passed the value 3.2, then it should return the value 50.176.

The file must be named: fall_distance.py
